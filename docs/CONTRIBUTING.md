## Where things live

| Path | |
| --- | --- |
| `Panel.qml` | the forked power panel: installed upstream plus our additions |
| `Model.js` | upstream, unchanged, and must stay that way |
| `Conservation.js` | pure logic for panel state and navigation: turning the helper's output into state, and moving the keyboard cursor between rows |
| `manifest.json` | plugin id, `clonedFrom: omarchy.power` |
| `bin/lenovo-power-conservation` | the only thing that runs as root |
| `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh` | one-time privileged setup, and its removal; `uninstall.sh` also offers to remove the polkit rule |
| `policy/lenovo-power-conservation.rules.example` | optional passwordless grant, never installed automatically; copied by hand to `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-lenovo-power-conservation.rules` |
| `upstream.lock` | pinned merge base and fetch coordinates |
| `tools/sync-upstream` | the three-way merge against upstream |
| `tests/` | both suites |

## Relationship to upstream

`Panel.qml` and `Model.js` are a copy of `shell/plugins/panels/power/` from
[basecamp/omarchy][omarchy]. `Model.js` is unchanged; `Panel.qml` is the
installed omarchy's panel plus the conservation section. `manifest.json` is the
only other upstream file this fork changes. `Conservation.js`, `bin/`, `policy/`
and `tests/` are new.

`manifest.json` declares `omarchy.clonedFrom: omarchy.power`, which is how
Omarchy lets a plugin replace a built-in one. A panel builds its own contents
inline; there is no API for another plugin to add a section to one, and
`clonedFrom` replaces the original rather than layering on top of it. The
alternative to forking is a separate bar widget with its own panel and IPC
target, which sits beside the Power panel instead of inside it.

`Panel.qml` keeps `moduleName` and `ipcTarget` at `omarchy.power` on purpose:
`clonedFrom` is what routes IPC and the bar slot, so rewriting those two
identifiers would detach the widget from its place in the bar and break
`omarchy-shell omarchy.power`.

## Keeping `Panel.qml` mergeable

`Panel.qml` is upstream's. Everything this fork adds is an insertion, never an
edit of a line upstream owns, and every block is marked:

```qml
// ---------- Lenovo battery conservation ----------
```

The merge is clean whenever the two sides do not share a line, so:

- Adding a whole new `Process { }`, function, or panel section is free.
- Changing a line upstream is also changing costs a conflict every time.
- Reformatting, reordering, or tidying upstream code costs a conflict forever
  and buys nothing.

Do not reformat `Model.js` unless a feature needs it. Upstream tests it in
`test/shell.d/power-test.sh`, so churn there makes future merges noisy.

The only edits inside code upstream owns are two methods appended to the existing
`IpcHandler` block, and the panel key dispatcher's `onMoveRequested` and
`onActivateRequested` handlers. If you add another, append it after those.

**Check a change stays mergeable rather than assuming it.** Three-way merge
`Panel.qml` against a deliberately adversarial upstream:

```bash
sha=$(sed -n 's/^sha=//p' upstream.lock)
git --git-dir=/tmp/omarchy-power-lenovo-battery-conservation-upstream.git \
    show "$sha:shell/plugins/panels/power/Panel.qml" > /tmp/base.qml
cp /tmp/base.qml /tmp/theirs.qml   # then add an upstream edit to theirs.qml
git merge-file --diff3 -p Panel.qml /tmp/base.qml /tmp/theirs.qml > /tmp/merged.qml
```

Insert into `theirs.qml` at the exact lines this fork appends to. A conflict
whose `||||||| base` section is empty means both sides only added lines, so
resolving is a matter of picking an order. A conflict with content in the base
section means something was edited, and that is the thing to avoid.

## Upstream

`upstream.lock` records the omarchy commit this fork tracks, and that commit is
the common ancestor for every merge.

```bash
tools/sync-upstream --check    # what upstream has done, and what we have, touches nothing
tools/sync-upstream --diff     # our changes against the pinned base, as a patch
tools/sync-upstream            # merge it in
```

`--check` and `--diff` change nothing and can be combined.

### Reading the fork's own diff before syncing

`tools/sync-upstream --diff` is the answer to "what have we changed here?", as a
patch rather than a line count. It diffs each tracked file against the pinned
sha, so it is this fork's delta whatever upstream has done since: it reads the
same when you are up to date, when upstream has moved, and before a merge has
run. Output is `git diff`, so it pages on a terminal and is a valid patch when
redirected:

```bash
tools/sync-upstream --diff > fork.patch
git apply --check --reverse fork.patch   # confirm it is exactly the current delta
```

A file that matches the pinned base does not appear at all (`Model.js` in
practice), which is the same signal `--check` gives as "identical to upstream".

### The merge

`sync-upstream` fetches `basecamp/omarchy` into a bare mirror under `$TMPDIR`
(override with `OMARCHY_UPSTREAM_MIRROR` if you want to keep it), then runs
`git merge-file --diff3` over `Panel.qml`, `Model.js` and `manifest.json`:

- **current** - this fork's file
- **base** - the file at the pinned sha
- **other** - the file at the current upstream tip

Changes that do not overlap combine on their own. Only genuinely conflicting
hunks stop for a human, and the markers are labelled so it is obvious which side
is which:

```
<<<<<<< ours (Panel.qml)
  Button { text: root.modeLabel() }   // FORK: ours
||||||| base (upstream c668141e)
  Button { }
=======
  Button { text: root.heroStatusText }   // upstream
>>>>>>> upstream (v4-0-4 c668141e)
```

The pin only advances when every file merged clean. Resolve a conflict, commit
the resolution, then re-run: it merges again from the still-unpinned base, which
by then matches your resolved file, so the second run comes back clean and
re-pins.

### Which upstream branch, and the ordering rule

**It tracks the omarchy you have installed: the release branch, not omarchy's
development branch.** That is the part worth understanding, because getting it
wrong is invisible until the widget fails to appear.

Every release has its own branch (`v4-0-1`, `v4-0-4`, ...), and they form a
fast-forward chain, so after `omarchy update` the pin walks forward from one
release to the next. `quattro` is omarchy's development branch and the repo's
default; merging against it would import panel code that no released omarchy has
yet.

A cloned first-party panel is not self-contained. It imports types and singleton
members that the shell provides, so panel code from a newer omarchy can
reference API this machine does not have:

| upstream commit | what `Panel.qml` gained | what happens on an older omarchy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `c231097d` | `ShellIpc`, plus its `qmldir` entry | `ShellIpc is not a type`; the widget never loads and the bar slot is simply empty |
| `b18ab495` | `Style.duration()`, `Style.reduceMotion` | `Style` exists, so these fail as missing members |

Neither produces an error anyone sees. So the order is: **update omarchy first,
then run `tools/sync-upstream`** to advance the pin. Until then, `--check`
reporting drift is correct information rather than an action item, and
`bin/check` fails if the panel ever outruns the shell again.

`--check` also compares the lock's `branch=` against the omarchy installed on
this machine and warns when they disagree, so that ordering rule is checked
rather than only written down. It warns and carries on: a fork tracking an older
omarchy is still a fork worth keeping in step.

After merging, run `bin/check`. The `Model.js` stage will tell you if the merge
touched something it should not have, and the shell API stages will tell you if
the merge outran the omarchy you are running.

## Checks

```bash
bin/check
```

Run it before committing. It is everything CI runs, plus the two stages that
need an Omarchy box. Any failing stage exits non-zero, and skipped stages are
listed, so a partial run never reads as green.

| Stage | Fails on |
| --- | --- |
| `bash -n`, once per script | a shell script that does not parse |
| `bin/check-agent-files` | an agent-instruction file anywhere in the tree |
| `manifest.json` parse | invalid JSON |
| `node --test`, both suites | any test failure |
| `Model.js` against the pinned upstream sha | any divergence at all (runs in CI too) |
| `qmllint` type resolution | `Panel.qml` referencing shell API this omarchy lacks |
| `Style` members | `Panel.qml` using a `Style` member the installed omarchy lacks |
| `omarchy plugin validate` | manifest schema |
| `tools/sync-upstream --check` | never; reports where this fork sits |

Four of those deserve a note.

**`Model.js` must stay byte-identical to upstream.** The README calls it
unchanged, and every line added to it is a line that can conflict on the next
sync. Upstream tests it in `test/shell.d/power-test.sh`, so churn there is noise
for them as well. If this stage fails, the fix is almost always to revert
`Model.js` and put the code somewhere else.

**The shell API stages are the important ones.** A cloned first-party panel is
not self-contained: it imports types and singleton members the shell provides,
so panel code from a newer omarchy can reference API this machine does not
have. `ShellIpc` and `Style.duration()` both shipped here first and both failed
silently, the widget just never appearing in the bar. Type resolution reuses
qmllint's own resolver rather than a hand-rolled list, so nothing new to
maintain; `signal-handler-parameters` is excluded because upstream's own file
produces it. The `Style` check exists separately because qmllint structurally
cannot catch a missing member on a singleton that does resolve.

**`qmllint` is otherwise gated on its exit status, not its output.** qmllint
reports everything as `Warning: ... [category]`, a fatal syntax error included,
so grepping for `Error` finds nothing. The exit code is the signal: 0 when the
file parses, 255 when it does not.

**The two shell API stages are gated separately, because they need different
things.** The `Style` check is `grep` against the installed `Style.qml` and needs
nothing but `$SHELL_DIR`; only type resolution runs `qmllint`. They used to sit
in one `if/elif`, so a box with Qt installed but unlinked skipped both and
reported the missing shell directory as the reason, which was false. `qmllint`
lives in `/usr/lib/qt6/bin` without a symlink into `/usr/bin`, so `command -v`
misses it on most boxes; `bin/check` probes that directory and the
`x86_64-linux-gnu` variant, then falls back to `PATH`. Each skip now names its
own cause, and a skip is a skip of one stage rather than two.

Stages skipped: no `omarchy` (off-box), no `qmllint` (not installed), no
upstream shell tree. The shell API stages can never run in CI, which has no
Omarchy; they run for anyone who clones the repo on an Omarchy box. The `Style`
stage runs anywhere `$SHELL_DIR` exists, so it runs with or without `qmllint`.

`bin/check` guards the two ways this fork has broken before: `Model.js` drifting
from upstream, and `Panel.qml` outrunning the shell API you are running.

## Tests

```bash
node --test tests/conservation.test.cjs   # the logic
node --test tests/helper.test.cjs         # the helper's arguments and writes
```

Neither needs root, a Lenovo, or anything in `/sys`. The helper's privileged
path is exercised through `unshare -r`, which maps the caller to uid 0 in a
throwaway user namespace, with the sysfs glob rewritten to point at a temporary
tree. The host is untouched.

`tests/conservation.test.cjs` covers `Conservation.js`: the words the helper
prints, the state mapping, and the value check that gates `pkexec`.
`tests/helper.test.cjs` covers `bin/lenovo-power-conservation`: argument
validation, exit codes, the write, and the agreement between the helper,
`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh` and `Panel.qml` about the path they share.

One gap, on purpose. The branch that reports a write the kernel refused needs a
sysfs attribute that rejects a value, which a plain file cannot be, so that test
asserts the check is present rather than pretending to exercise it.

## Keyboard navigation

The panel's keyboard cursor is upstream's own: `cursorActive` plus a flat
`profileIndex` into the profile buttons. We extend that rather than replace it,
so ours is one more boolean in the same idiom, `conservationFocused`, meaning
"the cursor is on our row instead of the profiles".

- `h`/`l` and the left/right arrows move between profiles, unchanged.
- `j`/`k` and up/down walk between the two rows, lighting exactly one row at a
  time.
- Return or Space activates whichever row the cursor is on.
- Hovering a row moves the cursor there, so mouse and keyboard agree and only
  one row is lit.

Two deliberate differences from a stock panel:

- Upstream sends `j`/`k` into the profile list. Here they change rows, and only
  `h`/`l` move between profiles.
- Our row is skipped entirely while it cannot act - before `install.sh` has run,
  or the mode has not been read - so the cursor cannot park on a toggle that
  would refuse to flip. The cost is that the row's "run `sudo ./install.sh`"
  message cannot be read with the keyboard alone.

The row's title is bold because the shared `Toggle` component hardcodes
`font.bold` on its label and offers no property to turn it off. Matching regular
weight, as the network panel's list rows use, would mean replacing a shared
component with a local one - and losing its tab focus and Return/Enter/Space
handling with it. The title size is set to `Style.font.body` so at least the
size matches the rows beside it.

The cursor stays where it was last put. Hovering a row leaves it lit after the
mouse moves away, because that is upstream's behaviour: `cursorActive` is only
ever cleared when the battery appears, so a profile button stays lit the same
way. We match it rather than giving our row a second hover model.

This is the one place where adding a feature meant changing upstream's code
rather than only adding to it: the key dispatcher's `onMoveRequested` and
`onActivateRequested`. Both now call one function of ours, and upstream's
`selectProfileByDelta`, `activateSelectedProfile` and `setProfile` are untouched
behind them. The rules in [Keeping `Panel.qml` mergeable](#keeping-panelqml-mergeable)
apply to those two handlers from now on.

## Security

The reasoning behind the root-owned helper lives in the README's
*How the privileged part works* section. The short version: the installed copy is the only
thing ever elevated, it takes no path from its caller, and it writes only `0` or
`1`.

If you touch `bin/lenovo-power-conservation`, `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh` or
`policy/`, read that section first. Two invariants the tests currently only
partly cover, and which you should not weaken:

- The helper never re-executes itself. `set` requires already being root, so a
  copy in a user-writable directory cannot elevate itself.
- `install.sh` must not copy the rules example into `/etc/polkit-1`. Nothing
  should persist in the system's authorisation policy unless a person asked for
  it. There is a test asserting exactly that.

## Not allowed in this tree

No `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `SKILL.md`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/` or
anything else `bin/check-agent-files` recognises. `omarchy plugin add` copies
this repository into a path coding agents auto-discover, and the marketplace
refuses plugins carrying those files. `bin/check` enforces it.

Also: no symlinks inside the plugin folder, no personal paths, no secrets, and
nothing machine-specific in fixtures or history.
